# C++ Object Oriented Programming
This repository contains all the files, notes and programs that I created while taking Tim Buchalka's ["Beggining C++ Programming - From Begginer to Beyond"](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wd43@XxjANhFiXw_Pm0FIVwTbh09BeXErECzAS4AckBURNs2Si2Y5SnoJCAINmKNXFOxs/) Course on Udemy which is taught by Frank Mitropoulos.

This repo focuses on the OOPs concepts that I learnt rather than the C++ specific concepts. I have also added some of my code and notes to this repository along with notes that are provided by Seneca College to learn C++ and gain a better understanding about the language. This repo also contains questions and challenges that have helped me to strengthen my concepts.
